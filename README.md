# 4-WEATHER-Project

## Check the weather! :cloud: 

In this repository you can find a file named ```main.py``` that triggers the Weatherbit.io Weather API, retrieving current weather observations from over 47,000 live weather stations, historical weather data for the past 10 years from the archive of more than 120,000 stations, and highly localized weather forecasts for any point on the globe using the world's most trusted weather models!

If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```$ python main.py ``` it will  give you results similar to the following: 

```
$ python main.py  
In Catania (Italy) the day 2020-12-03 , min temp is 10.5 ,max temp is 15.9 with light shower rain.
